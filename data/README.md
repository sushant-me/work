# Where each file here comes from

**Everything in this directory ships with the app and is served offline.** This page records what
produced each file, because a dataset with no recipe is not data - it is an artefact somebody made
once, and `bus-parks.geojson` was exactly that until round 27.

| File | Produced by | Reproducible? |
|---|---|---|
| `trails.geojson` | `scripts/build_trails.py` | **yes** — 4 OSM regions; `--fetch` downloads them |
| `bus-parks.geojson` | `scripts/build_bus_stops.py` | **yes** — `--fetch` |
| `terrain.bin`, `terrain.json` | `scripts/build_terrain.py` | **yes** — AWS Terrain Tiles |
| `advisories.json` | `scripts/build_advisories.py` | **yes** |
| `slopes-live-*.geojson`, `slopes-chirps-*.geojson`, `frames.json` | `scripts/build_watch_geojson.py` | **yes** |
| `timeline.json` | `scripts/build_timeline.py` | **yes** |
| `observability-sites.json` | `scripts/build_observability.py` | **yes** - from `reports/observability-monsoon.json` |
| `observability-by-month.json` | `scripts/build_observability.py` | **yes** |
| `demo-script.json` | hand-written, bilingual, bundled by the phone |
| `provenance.json` | what each headline number on the map means, the file it is derived from, and what it does not say | Derived at build time from `timeline.json`, `trails.geojson`, `places.geojson`, `susceptibility.json` and `complaint-index.json`, so the values cannot drift from the data they describe. The caveats are the sentences the guards in `tests/` enforce. |
| `complaint-index.json` | `scripts/build_complaint_index.py` | **yes** - a derived join, no network |
| `places.geojson` | `scripts/build_places.py` | **yes** - a join, no network |
| `panoramas/*.png` | `scripts/render_panorama.py` | **yes** - rendered from the DEM, offline |
| `susceptibility.json` | `scripts/build_susceptibility.py` | **yes** - 688 MB Zenodo raster, sampled |
| `administration.json` | `scripts/build_administration.py` | **yes** - cached in `evidence/`, no network |
| `seasons.json` | `scripts/build_seasons.py` | **yes** - Open-Meteo ERA5; `--fetch` |
| `terrain-texture.jpg` | `scripts/build_terrain_texture.py` | **in kind** - exact geometry, reconstructed palette |

## susceptibility.json is the first number here that is not ours

Every hazard judgement in this repository was measured by us or ranked against our own 613 slopes.
Both are honest and neither is peer-reviewed. This is **Kincey et al. (2023), a national 30 m
rainfall-triggered landslide susceptibility surface, CC-BY-4.0** -
[zenodo.org/records/8307964](https://zenodo.org/records/8307964).

Sampled at our own slope coordinates: **534 of 613 match**, range **0.031 - 0.580**, median 0.227.
The app can now say *"this ground is in the published high-susceptibility class"* and cite a source
that is not this project.

**What it is not.** A susceptibility model says where failure is more likely across a country. It
does not say whether a slope is moving today. The two are reported side by side and neither is
presented as the other - which is the same line the rainfall work already holds.

Two bugs the build caught, both of which would have shipped a plausible wrong answer:

1. **The raster is EPSG:32645 (UTM 45N), our coordinates are WGS84.** `rasterio.sample()` reads its
   input in the raster's own CRS, so the first run passed degrees as metres and every point came back
   missing. The script refused to write a blank file, which is the only reason it was noticed.
2. **The nodata sentinel is not NaN.** This raster marks emptiness with the float32 minimum,
   -3.4e38, so an `isnan` test passed it through and the reported range began at minus three hundred
   undecillion. It now honours the raster's own nodata.

## administration.json is somebody else's good data, and it closed a real gap

77 districts and 753 local units, each with a Nepali name, a district, a province and an **official
gov.np website**. Source: [rgtstha/NEPAL-QUEST-DATA](https://github.com/rgtstha/NEPAL-QUEST-DATA),
community-maintained open data. Fetched once, cached in `evidence/`, compiled offline.

It exists because I had been solving this from first principles and failing at it twice: Overpass
returned four of six regions as empty, and the gazetteer that came out was an Annapurna list. This
repository had the whole country all along.

**What it fixed.** The complaint drafter used to say *"Ward Committee under the Ward Chair"* - a true
description of the duty and a useless address. Now it reads the slope's own title, matches it against
the 753 units, and names the office that exists:

    Landslide at Lamekhat, Jaljala Rural Municipality-4
      ->  Jaljala, Parbat district, गण्डकी प्रदेश, https://jaljalamun.gov.np/

494 of the 613 documented slopes resolve. The other 119 name a unit the gazetteer does not carry or
in a form that does not match, and the letter says so rather than inventing one.

## seasons.json is mostly valid and says so

Twelve-month climate normals per trail region, so the app can answer "when should I go". ERA5 is a
~28 km reanalysis and the Himalaya is its worst case: it gives Manaslu **8,228 mm a year** against a
real figure nearer 1,000-1,900, and calls April its wettest month.

So the file carries a cross-check against this repository's own CHIRPS measurement, and it does not
flatter all six regions:

| region | ERA5 ÷ CHIRPS, Jun-Sep | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Kathmandu | **1.89** | **not reliable - should not be quoted** |
| Manaslu | 1.54 | passes the monsoon check, annual total still wrong |
| Annapurna | 1.13 | reliable |
| Upper Mustang | 1.06 | reliable |
| Langtang | 0.83 | reliable |
| Khumbu | 0.71 | reliable |

Only **June to September** could be checked, because that is the window CHIRPS covers here. The
other eight months are marked `validated: false`. The guide reports what the model says and states
which parts of it have been tested - it does not label a month good or bad, because a farmer, a
trekker and a paraglider want different weather from the same month.

## Every file here now has a recipe

Round 28 found four files with no generator: the bus stops, and the two observability files, and the
flythrough backdrop. All four have one now.

### terrain-texture.jpg is reconstructed, not reproduced

It is 2048x1260, and 2048/1260 is 1.625 - exactly the 832x512 aspect of the bundled DEM - so it is
a colour-shaded render of that same grid. `scripts/build_terrain_texture.py` renders it from
`terrain.bin` and produces the **same dimensions and the same geography**. What it cannot reproduce
is the original's **palette**: the colormap that made the committed file was not kept, so this draws
its own hypsometric ramp.

**The served file is therefore left alone.** Regenerating it would change how the 3D flythrough
looks, and replacing a working backdrop with a differently-shaded one to make a table tidier is the
same class of mistake as the observability attempt that would have silently swapped two quoted
figures. The script writes to a scratch path by default; the served path is opt-in.

### The other three were closed outright

Both observability files, and the bus stops. `scripts/build_observability.py` reproduces them
**exactly** from `reports/observability-monsoon.json` - JSON-equal to the committed files - and
refuses to write if the monsoon total stops matching 2,021 scenes.
