# The app, running on an Android device

Not a mock-up and not a render. These are `adb screencap` frames from the release APK installed and
launched on an Android emulator (API 36, x86_64, `/dev/kvm`) on 2026-10-01.

## What this changes, and what it does not

**Changed:** the app compiles, installs, launches, renders Nepali text, responds to touch, switches
tabs, reads its bundled trail data and lists trails by distance. Fifty rounds of "nothing has run on
a real handset" end here.

**Unchanged, and still stated everywhere:** this is an **emulator**, not a physical phone. No radio
figure has been measured on real hardware - Bluetooth range, Wi-Fi Aware range and battery endurance
are all still somebody else's measurements or modelled from them. An emulator cannot measure a radio.

## On a budget phone, not the flagship

Every frame in this directory before this round was taken at **1080x2340 at 440 dpi**, which is a
flagship. The people this app is for do not carry one. The same APK was run at **720x1280 at 320
dpi**:

    adb shell wm size 720x1280
    adb shell wm density 320

The language chooser renders clean, both scripts legible, buttons full width. The Escape tab - the
densest screen, four panels deep - renders with no overflow, and `adb logcat` reports no
`RenderFlex overflowed`. The Nepali office line is present and correct at the smaller size.

Scrolled to the very bottom, the "यहाँबाट कहाँ जाने?" button clears the tab bar with space to spare,
so the list's bottom padding is enough and no content is unreachable behind the navigation bar. That
was the specific thing worth checking: a list whose last item sits under the tab bar can never be
fully read, and it would not show on the large screen at all.

The Walk tab is the other dense screen and it renders whole at the smaller size: the twelve-month
chart with its four validated months green and eight model-only months grey, the caveat that green
means checked against this project's own measurement, the warning not to quote this region's rainfall
figure, the sentence about a farmer, a trekker and a paraglider wanting different weather from the same
month, and the major-places list beneath it. All legible at 320 dpi.

`adb logcat` across the whole run reports no Flutter layout error. The only exceptions in the log are
Android's own `BestClock: no network time available`, which is the emulator having no network and not
this app.

### The other language, for the other user

Sixteen frames in this directory were in Nepali. The app is built for residents AND for visitors, and
the English interface had never been looked at on a device - so a whole half of the intended audience
was unverified while the other half was photographed fifteen times.

It holds. The Walk tab in English:

    Pahiro . Which way to run, and how high
    What can I walk from here
    at 27.7047, 85.3146
    When to go
    Kathmandu valley and the Shivapuri rim
    Green months are cross-checked against this project's own measurement;
    grey are model output only.
    This region failed that check - its rain figures should not be quoted.
    These twelve months were measured for here, and no month is called good or bad.
    A farmer, a trekker and a paraglider want different weather from the same month.
    Major places near you
    Kathmandu 2 km . 845767 . slopes 5 . trails 3757 . kathmandu.gov.np
    ...
    These are 277 of Nepal's 753 local units - the ones that could be located, because a
    position is the mean of the documented slopes inside them.

Every abstention survives the translation, including the red warning that this region's rainfall figure
should not be quoted. Nothing falls back to the other language; there is no Nepali string left in the
English screen and no English left in the Nepali one.

**Note what is deliberately absent:** the place names are English only here, not "Kathmandu .
काठमाडौँ". The bilingual name is the affordance of the Nepali interface; showing Devanagari to a
visitor who chose English would be decoration rather than information.

### Larger text, because the people this is for use it

Devanagari at a larger scale is where a text-heavy layout breaks: labels collide, lines clip, buttons
overflow. Both common accessibility scales were run at 720x1280:

    adb shell settings put system font_scale 1.3
    adb shell settings put system font_scale 1.5

At 1.3 the long English place name wraps to two lines and the Nepali duty-holder line wraps to two,
with nothing clipped or overlapped. At 1.5, the accessibility standard, the same holds: every string
wraps rather than truncating, the tab bar labels still fit, and `adb logcat` reports zero RenderFlex
overflows at both scales.

The content is taller and the last line sits below the fold at 1.5x, which is what a scrolling list is
for. Nothing is unreachable.

**What this does not establish:** the AVD is still an emulator, at a size set by `wm` rather than a
1280-pixel panel, on API 36. Font rendering, memory pressure and touch latency on a real budget
handset are not measured here and are not claimed.

## Handing the plan to somebody else

The escape plan is the one thing here worth forwarding - to a neighbour, a family member, whoever is
deciding whether to move. It now has a **पठाउनुहोस् / Send this** button beside the speaker.

Shared as **text, not a link**, and that is a deliberate finding rather than a shortcut: this project has
no deployed web address.

    grep for any http(s) host outside github/OSM/zenodo/...   ->  none

A link would point nowhere, and a message that opens to nothing is worse than no message. What is sent
is the plan itself:

    पहिरो — भाग्ने योजना (यो फोनमै गणना गरिएको)
    यो क्षेत्रीय सुझाव हो, स्थानीय निर्देशन पालना गर्नुहोस्।
    - नजिकै सुरक्षित उचाइ छैन
    - दौडन नखोज्नुहोस्
    - अग्लो बहुतले भवनमा जानुहोस्
    - सक्दो माथिल्लो तल्लामा जानुहोस्
    यो यही फोनमा, इन्टरनेट बिना गणना गरिएको हो।

**Verified on the device:** pressing it opens the system share sheet -

    WindowManager: OPEN ... com.android.intentresolver/.ChooserActivity
    ChooserActivity: onAppTargetsLoaded

and a failure to share falls back to the same honest message the speaker uses, rather than doing
nothing.

## The place comes back where you left it

The behaviour PR #5 declared as unverified, now driven on the emulator:

    <open the dropdown, choose पोखरा · Pokhara>
    adb shell am force-stop np.pahiro.pahiro_field
    <relaunch>
    -> the dropdown reads पोखरा · Pokhara

Not the default मेल्म्ची · Melamchi. The choice survived the process, the same way the language does, and
the frame above is the relaunch.

The dropdown offers six places - Melamchi, Beni, Barhabise, Pokhara, Kathmandu and Nepalgunj - each with
its Nepali name and the reason it is on the list ("the Terai, where nothing is near").

## What actually gets sent

The share sheet, photographed with its content rather than just its presence. This is the whole point of
sharing the plan as text: a neighbour receives the steps, in Nepali, with the caveat attached.

    पहिरो — भाग्ने योजना (यो फोनमै गणना गरिएको)
    यो क्षेत्रीय सुझाव हो, स्थानीय निर्देशन पालना गर्नुहोस्।
    - नजिकै सुरक्षित उचाइ छैन
    - दौडन नखोज्नुहोस्
    - अग्लो बहुतले भवनमा जानुहोस्
    - सक्दो माथिल्लो तल्लामा जानुहोस्

"Regional advice - follow local instructions" travels with it, because a forwarded message loses its
context the moment it leaves the phone it was computed on.

## A REAL PHONE, WITH THE RADIOS OFF

Nineteen rounds of verification happened on an emulator. This is the first on hardware the project did
not control.

    adb devices -l
    RZ8RB0AGYNW   device usb:1-1   product:f22ins   model:SM_E225F   device:f22

    samsung SM-E225F          Galaxy F22
    Android 13 (SDK 33)       the emulator is API 36 - a genuinely different target
    720x1600 @ 300dpi         a low-end panel, not the emulator's 1080x2340
    arm64-v8a

**The offline claim, tested properly.** Not by blackholing a hostname, but by turning the radios off on
the handset:

    adb shell svc wifi disable; adb shell svc data disable
    settings get global wifi_on     -> 0
    settings get global mobile_data -> 0
    dumpsys connectivity            -> Active default network: none

Then force-stop and relaunch. **The app rendered the full escape screen, the responsible-office panel
with its statute and its own caveat, the 360-degree panorama, and ran the flood scenario - with no
network at all, and zero fatal exceptions in logcat across the entire run.**

What step 2 of the scenario says, on the phone, offline:

    In August only 16.8% of satellite scenes were usable, and 17 of 142 sites were never seen at all.
    So the system does not say 'all clear' - it says it cannot see.
    cited - Sentinel-2 scene metadata, 2,021 scenes

Frames in this directory: `pahiro-physical-walk-panorama.png`, `pahiro-physical-offline.png`,
`pahiro-physical-demo-step1.png`, `pahiro-physical-demo-step2.png`.

**Still not verified, and it cannot be from here:** whether the Nepali speech is actually AUDIBLE. The app
was run with sound, but nothing in this environment can listen to it. That needs a person holding the
phone.

## The app remembers which language you chose

Until this round it asked "Choose your language" on every single launch - the first thing anybody sees,
and the wrong first impression for a tool that is otherwise careful about first impressions.

    adb shell pm clear np.pahiro.pahiro_field        # fresh install: it must ask
    <choose Nepali>
    adb shell am force-stop np.pahiro.pahiro_field   # a user closing the app
    <relaunch>

**It goes straight to the Escape tab in Nepali.** No chooser. The frame above this section is that
relaunch.

Implemented with `shared_preferences` 2.5.5, and three deliberate choices in it:

- the write is **fire and forget**, so a tap never waits on a disk write
- `remembered()` returns null on **any** failure, so a broken preference store asks again rather than
  showing a blank screen
- `main()` restores **after** the first frame and only when `!chosen`, so a restore can never overwrite
  a choice the user just made

Three widget tests cover exactly those three properties, including the one that would be silent: a
stale restore overwriting a live choice.

## Regression check after eighty rounds

Every edit in this project is followed by a build, and this is the check that the whole thing still
runs: the release APK built from the current tree, installed on API 36, and launched.

    flutter build apk --release     ->  51.9 MB
    adb install -r app-release.apk  ->  Success
    monkey -p np.pahiro.pahiro_field ...  ->  language chooser, correct
    logcat | grep -c "flutter.*exception|RenderFlex|overflowed"  ->  0

The APK grew 0.2 MB this session, from the snackbars that now say speech is unavailable instead of
failing silently. Nothing else moved a byte in the direction of breakage: the panel work, the l10n
keys, the duty-loader injection, the places note and the speech handling all compile and run.

Worth stating because the last twenty rounds touched main.dart nine times, once with brace surgery that
had already destroyed the file in an earlier round and was reverted then. This is the frame that says it
did not happen again.

## The duty holder, in Nepali, on the device

    वडा समिति (वडा अध्यक्षको नेतृत्वमा); माथि नगर/गाउँ कार्यपालिका (प्रमुख/अध्यक्ष)

One entry in one table in src/pahiro/complaints.py, because there is exactly one distinct office
across all 613 slopes. Read by the Python letter and by the phone's derived index, so the letter and
the card above it cannot end up in two languages.

## The expanded letter, tested by name instead of by pixel

Four emulator attempts to press the draft button all missed, because it sits below three other panels
and its y-coordinate moves with the content above it while I read the position off a scaled
screenshot. The conclusion last round was that the instrument was wrong, not the aim.

The replacement does not guess a coordinate at all:

    await tester.ensureVisible(button);
    await tester.tap(button);

`find.text('उजुरीको मस्यौदा देखाउनुहोस्')` cannot miss, and the assertions after it are about the letter
that four device attempts never captured:

    धारा १२(२)(ग)              the section, in Devanagari
    स्वचालित रूपमा तयार भएको    it says it was drafted automatically
    वडा समिति                   the Nepali office name

And a second test asserts the English office string is NOT rendered in the Nepali interface - the
regression that the device showed me last round.

FINDING IT REQUIRED MAKING THE PANEL INJECTABLE

The panel read its asset with rootBundle directly, so inside a widget test the load failed, the
catch swallowed it, and the panel returned an empty box - the feature was untestable AND, in
production, a missing asset would be a missing panel with no signal anywhere.

It now takes a `DutyLoader` defaulting to the asset one, matching the trail, season and DEM loaders.
That is the fourth time in this project that "make it injectable" was the precondition for being able
to check it at all.

    ढलानहरूको औसत हो, नगर केन्द्र होइन।

Bilingual names, population, district, how many slopes are documented there, how densely OSM has
mapped trails nearby, and the unit's own official website. Every field is one a machine checked -
there is no prose in the file, because prose about a place is the one thing nothing here can verify.

A list, not the web app's map: there is no map widget in this app, and adding a mapping library to
draw 277 dots would be a dependency the offline bundle carries for one screen. The data is the same
file either way, and the caption says which it is.

Godawari shows **पदमार्ग 0** - no mapped trails within ten kilometres - which is the same "gap in the
map, not proof that nobody walks here" case the trail list reports, rendered here as a zero.

## The flood scenario, on the phone

    बाढी आउँदा एपले के गर्छ
    हरियो चरण यही फोनमै गणना हुन्छ; खैरा यही परियोजनाको अन्त कतै गरिएको नाप हो।
    [ परिदृश्य चलाउनुहोस् ]

Six steps of the monsoon of 2024, and each one is LABELLED for whether it is computed on this phone
or cited from a measurement made elsewhere in this project. Four are live - the duty routing, the
escape planner, the complaint and the beacon, all of which the phone really does - and two are the
rainfall count and the satellite blindness, which were measured on a machine with the full 613-slope
record.

A demo that blurred measured and cited numbers would be the same failure as every stale caption in
this project, so the distinction is on the screen rather than in a speaker's note.

**Verified, on the second attempt.** The first attempt reported the button rendering but not
advancing, and the reason was my taps: I read the coordinate off the SCALED preview (872x1890) while
the device is 1080x2340, so I pressed at y=900 against a button spanning y=780-879. Tapping y=830
advanced it:

    1. २०२४ सेप्टेम्बर २८ — ... ६१३ मध्ये ३१ ढलान वर्षाको सीमाभन्दा माथि थिए।
       यहाँ उद्धृत · CHIRPS daily rainfall, 613 documented slopes
    2. अगस्टमा उपग्रहको तस्बिरको १६.८% मात्र प्रयोगयोग्य थियो, र १४२ मध्ये १७ स्थान कहिल्यै देखिएन।
       यहाँ उद्धृत · Sentinel-2 scene metadata, 2,021 scenes
       [ अर्को चरण (2/6) ]

Both steps render, the grey "cited" label is right on both, and the counter advanced 1/6 to 2/6.

This is the third time this session a coordinate read off a scaled preview produced a wrong
conclusion - once as a false bug report, twice as a false "it does not work"

## The complaint, drafted on the phone

    मैले 27.81294, 85.59097 निर्देशांकको ढलानमा जोखिम देखेको छु।
    यो स्थान Melamchi, Sindhupalchok जिल्ला भित्र पर्छ।
    स्थानीय सरकार सञ्चालन ऐन, २०७४ को धारा १२(२)(ग) बमोजिम सडकसँग जोडिएको पहिरो हटाउने
    दायित्व ... को हो।
    कृपया यो स्थानको निरीक्षण गरी आवश्यक व्यवस्था मिलाउनुहुन अनुरोध गर्दछु। यो पत्र स्वचालित
    रूपमा तयार भएको हो र यसले कुनै कानुनी कारबाही सुरु गर्दैन।
    [तपाईंको नाम]  [सम्पर्क नम्बर]  [मिति]

Composed on the phone from the row, with no Python and no network: the coordinates, the district,
the office the routing key holds responsible, the section that obliges it, and a statement on the
face of the letter that it was drafted automatically and starts no proceeding. The citizen sends it
and keeps the receipt - which the app says it does not do for them.

**Still English inside the Nepali letter:** the office string itself, "Ward Committee under the Ward
Chair; municipal executive (Mayor/Chair) above it", because those descriptions live in the routing key
and are not translated. Fixing it properly means translating the duty map, not the letter - and it is
named here rather than patched in the widget, which is the mistake the beacon card taught.

## Who is responsible for the ground, on the phone

    यो जमिन कसको जिम्मामा
    Landslide at Baguwa, Melamchi Municipality-10          2.3 km
    Melamchi — Sindhupalchok
    https://www.melamchimun.gov.np/en
    Ward Committee under the Ward Chair; municipal executive (Mayor/Chair) above it
    LGOA 2074 s.12(2)(c)(23) 'Remove floods, landslides in the roads'; ...

Every complaint portal in Nepal routes to a municipality, and a municipality can say "not ours" and be
finished with it. This names the office the routing key holds responsible AND the local unit that
office belongs to, with the unit's own gov.np site, so a letter can be addressed to something that
exists rather than to "the municipality".

It says what it does not know, in the same card: the office is the routing key's DEFAULT holder for a
local road rather than a per-parcel determination, and 119 of the 613 slopes name a unit the national
gazetteer does not carry - for those it reports the office and invents no address.

The phone carries a 271 KB derived index rather than the 2.5 MB hazard record, because answering
"whose ground is this" does not need 153 days of rainfall per slope.

## Look around the valley, on the phone

    उपत्यका हेर्नुहोस्
    [ the Kathmandu valley skyline, 360 degrees, draggable ]
    यो तस्बिर होइन — उचाइको डेटाबाट बनाइएको ३६०° को चित्र हो। रूख, घर वा जमिनको रङ यसमा छैन;
    आकृति मात्र। दायाँबायाँ तान्नुहोस्।

The six panoramas are bundled into the APK, 264 KB for the whole country's walking regions, because
the places a valley view matters most are the places with no signal. Dragging left and right walks
the full 360; the aspect is 2:1 because that is what an equirectangular projection is.

And the caption refuses the obvious mistake: this is NOT a photograph. It is a silhouette from the
elevation grid the app already carries - shape, no trees, no buildings, a gradient sky.

## When to go, on the phone

The Walk tab now answers the other half of the question. Twelve bars of measured rainfall for the
nearest region, and the honesty rendered as colour rather than as a footnote:

    J 1   F 1   M 2   A 2   M 6   [J 12]  [J 26]  [A 21]  [S 13]  O 2   N 0   D 0
    grey -------- grey --------      green: cross-checked against our own CHIRPS measurement

    हरियो महिना यही परियोजनाको नापसँग जाँचिएका; खैरा केवल मोडेलको अनुमान।
    यो क्षेत्रको वर्षाको अङ्क जाँचमा उत्तीर्ण भएन — यसलाई उद्धृत नगर्नुहोस्।

That last line is Kathmandu's own failure, on the screen: ERA5 puts nearly twice the measured monsoon
there, so the app tells the user not to quote the numbers it is drawing. Twelve confident bars with a
happy summary would have been easier and would have been the exact claim this project exists to
refuse.

The trail list is below it and both work together - the season guide is additional information, never
a precondition for finding a walk.

## The frame card, translated without touching the codec

    20 बाइट · 4 बाँकी 24 मध्ये
    23373632afe320002a4a5600822d22005b15b935
    2 जना · अत्यावश्यक
    स्थान 27.71542, 85.31234
    ttl 6 · 1 पटक अगाडि बढेको
    बाइट हावामा पठाउन सक्ने एप हो यो। ब्राउजरले सक्दैन।

`peopleText` and `severity` come from the beacon codec, which the byte-parity tests share with the
JavaScript side. Localising THE CODEC to fix a caption would be the beginning of two implementations
drifting apart, so the Nepali is composed in the widget from the decoded **numbers** - `people` is an
int and the widget phrases it - and the codec stays English on both sides.

`ttl` is left as-is: it is a protocol field name, like MB, not prose.

## The screen that was half-translated

The Settings tab asked a Nepali question and answered it in English:

    यो फोनमा के चल्छ                    <- "what runs on this phone"
    vision - sees change between two images and speaks Nepali on the handset, offline
    needs ~867 MB resident, 93 MB on disk

In a Nepali-first app, on the one screen that tells a user what the model costs them. The heading was
translated, the body was two hardcoded English strings, and neither the tests nor a dozen readings of
the Dart file had noticed - because the only way to see it is to switch the app to Nepali and scroll.

Fixed, rebuilt, reinstalled and photographed:

    यो फोनमा के चल्छ
    vision - दुई तस्बिरबीचको फरक देख्छ र फोनमै नेपाली बोल्छ, इन्टरनेट बिना
    करिब 867 MB स्मृति चाहिन्छ, 93 MB डिस्कमा

The `Tier` class gained an optional `noteNe` defaulting to empty, so a tier added later without a
translation falls back to English instead of failing to compile - a missing translation is a gap to
fill, not a reason the app will not build.

## The empty screen the device exposed

The Board tab had nothing to show, because no other phone has sent anything - and until this round it
said only "there are no messages right now". On a phone, that sentence cannot be told apart from a
broken feature. It now says what the board is for and which of the two reasons applies:

    यो बोर्डले नजिकैका फोनबाट ब्लुटुथमा आएका सन्देश देखाउँछ। खाली हुनुको अर्थ दुईमध्ये एक हो:
    कसैले पठाएको छैन, वा नजिकमा अर्को फोन छैन। फोन सँगै राख्नुहोस्।

Six rounds ago I wrote the same fix for the missing trail data ("a gap in the map, not proof that
nobody walks here"). This is the same failure in a different place, and the device is what showed it.

## The 20-byte claim, as bytes on a screen

Pressing "नमुना फ्रेम बनाउनुहोस्" on the Beacon tab encodes a real advertisement and prints it:

    20 बाइट · 4 spare of 24
    233736760ee320002a4a5600822d22005b15b5ef

    2 people · critical
    position 27.71542, 85.31234
    ttl 6 · hops 1 (relayed once)

    A Flutter app can put bytes on the air. A browser cannot.

Twelve bytes of payload inside a twenty-byte frame, four bytes under the 24-byte advertisement limit
that a Bluetooth advertisement actually allows. This is the claim the whole mesh rests on, and it is
now a hex string on a phone rather than a table in a document.

The last line is the honest reason this half exists as a mobile app at all: a browser cannot put bytes
on the air, so the disaster half cannot live in the web app however hard anyone tries.

Note the aeroplane icon: the frame still encodes with no network, because encoding is computation and
not transmission - which is exactly the distinction the design turns on.

## Offline, proven with the radio actually off

The same Walk tab, with airplane mode enabled and `dumpsys connectivity` reporting
**"Active default network: none"**:

    before  131 m   675 m   343 m   84 m   2792 m   2383 m
    offline 131 m   675 m   343 m   84 m   2792 m   2383 m

Identical. The trail list is read from the 5.4 MB bundle inside the APK; nothing is fetched, nothing
is cached from a previous request, and the distances are computed on the phone. This is the claim a
whole product rests on, and it is now a screenshot with the aeroplane icon in the status bar.

## The refusal, on a device, is the best evidence in the repository

Pressing "यहाँबाट कहाँ जाने?" at Melamchi returns:

    नजिकै सुरक्षित उचाइ छैन
    "There is no safe height nearby. Within walking distance there is no ground an estimated 5 m
    higher, or that direction is not uphill. दौडन नखोज्नुहोस् - do not try to run: find a strong
    building and go to the highest floor you can. पहिले खोलाबाट टाढा जानुहोस् - first move away
    from the stream. This map is based on a grid of about 1082 metres, so treat it as regional."

The app would rather tell somebody not to run than point them at ground that is not higher. That is
the whole design, and it is now a screenshot rather than an intention.

## One thing the device showed that no test did

Every trail near Kathmandu renders as **(unnamed path)**. That is correct - OSM does not name most
urban footpaths - and the app says so instead of inventing a label. The bundle holds 979 named trails
out of 23,726, and the phone is honest about the other 22,747.
