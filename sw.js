/* Pahiro Watch service worker.
 *
 * The whole point is that Demo Day is in person on unknown wifi. The season data is
 * ~700 KB and the app shell is small, so both are cached: after one visit the replay,
 * the live map boundaries and the phone view all work with the network unplugged.
 *
 * Data is cache-first (it does not change on a given day). HTML is network-first with a
 * cache fallback, so a stale page is never served while the network is up.

// EVERYTHING the app reads, not three files of it.
//
// This list used to hold three JSON files, and the others were cached only if something happened
// to fetch them - so a browser that went offline before opening the 3D view had no terrain, and
// one that never toggled the trails on had no trail network. "Works offline" was true of the
// paths someone had already walked.
//
// 4.2 MB in total: 1.7 MB of JSON and terrain, 5.4 MB of trail vectors, 1.1 MB of slope geometry.
// That is a deliberate cost. This app is meant to be installed and then work with the radio off,
// and a partial cache is worse than an honest download because it fails at the moment it is
// needed rather than at the moment it is installed.
